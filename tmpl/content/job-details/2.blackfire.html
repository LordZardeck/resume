		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Conceptualized and designed a robust Library Administration Software Application, 
					wrote an application manual for the software, trained users in the operation of 
					the software, and provided on-call technical support. Software was built using 
					PHP / CakePHP, Apache / Nginx, MySQL, CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, Dojo Toolkit, Ext.js, 
					and running on Ubuntu.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Responsible for all client and server side architecture, hardware set ups, the 
					integration of the application into existing internal applications and external 
					sources (API’s) as well as the use of REST based philosophies.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Eventually transitioned the software application into a single page instance to 
					allow for better performance and user experience, utilized Dojo and Ext.js to 
					accomplish this endeavor.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Developed a static HTML and Bootstrap based website for a cabin rental company, 
					a custom WordPress website for a Personal Life Coach which required the 
					development of custom elements to meet the project stakeholder’s needs, and a JQuery 
					quiz plug-in for a foster care site, <a href="http://www.lovetonurture.com">www.lovetonurture.com</a>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Developed a social platform for a popular trading card game, Redemption Connect 
					(which has since been taken down) which allowed users to search for any card that 
					existed which matched the user’s description of what they were looking and provided 
					a near exact result by using a "fuzzy search algorithm".
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Provided supplementary features for the platform, including a "deck export feature" 
							The platform allowed users to export their deck collection to a specific file format 
							which could be read and imported into the table simulator
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The platform scraped the company's site for tournaments and allowed users to search via 
							locations via the Google Maps API and send a direct RSVP to them.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Developed robust card creator that allowed the creation of realistic fan-made cards. 
							Developed game lobby utilizing Node.js and a web-browser to connect old VB6 table simulator 
							across strict NAT protected networks. Also integrated all of this with plug-ins for the 
							simple forums machine forum software		
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Took on a project to improve a secured retail shopping e-commerce platform.  Worked with JSON, 
					XML, and SOAP web services on the backend, PHP &amp; Guzzle to collect and process analytic &amp; 
					affiliate data for shopping site:  <a href="https://cocoonshopping.com/">https://cocoonshopping.com/</a>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Developed a JQuery quiz plug-in for a foster care site, 
					<a href="http://www.lovetonurture.com">www.lovetonurture.com</a>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Implemented a custom video management tool, silder 
					(<a href="https://gist.github.com/LordZardeck/7205720">https://gist.github.com/LordZardeck/7205720</a>), 
					which allowed videos using the FlexSlider toolkit to stop the slider when playing and continue the 
					slider when done.  Built the solution after participating in a Github discussion regarding an issue 
					with said product which resolved the slide change issues that various YouTube users were running 
					into when viewing a video.	
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Developed a JavaScript engine for the Dojo toolkit, DojoCake 
					(<a href="https://github.com/LordZardeck/DojoCake">https://github.com/LordZardeck/DojoCake</a>), 
					which was integrated into the CakePHP framework and allowed JavaScript UI controls to be easily embedded 
					into PHP based applications in a similar fashion to ASP.NET.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					DojoCake is a library of Helpers and Components for the PHP framework CakePHP. It was originally planned 
					to just be a JavaScript helper to replace the built-in Prototype Framework support. When CakePHP released 
					v1.3.x, they added support for JavaScript Engines. Seeing the potential to be much more than just a 
					JavaScript Engine, DojoCake was changed to a library to support the entire Ajax experience using the 
					Dojo Toolkit and the CakePHP framework. DojoCake now has support for Response Protocols, XHR Requests, 
					Complete Dojo dependency management, and Dojo Widgets.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Additionally, wrote and published an article on the use of Dojo Cake which can be found here:
