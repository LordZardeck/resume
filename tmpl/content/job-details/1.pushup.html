	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			Currently serving as a Web Engineer with responsibilities over the
			architecture of all UI / UX components for Pushup Socialâ€™s suite of
			web based and native mobile applications using CSS3, HTML5, and LESS
			to allow for nesting and real complication.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			In addition to client side responsibilities took on server side and
			presentation layer development work, specifically using Node.js,
			Express.js, Grunt.js for running tasks, npm for packet management,
			MongoDB as a data store, and connect.js for managing high availability
			database server environments.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Worked hand in hand with another Software Engineer to re-write the entire
			application using TypeScript and Knockout.js within a little over a month.
			The re-implementation allowed for static typing and type checking at compile
			time thereby resulting in the Pushup software application to scale appropriately
			through the use of only necessary syntax.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Served as the sole resource in the development of the Pushup Social Windows
			Phone mobile application using C#.  Gathered and made modifications to
			requirements, provided architecture and design for the product, and developed /
			deployed the solution within 50 hours and without any prior experience in
			native mobile application development.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Assisted the organization in transitioning from the Jasmine testing framework
			to the Selenium testing suite.
