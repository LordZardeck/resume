	<p>
	I am a Web Developer and technology enthusiast who has been developing web applications 
	since I was 15 years old. From server-side to client-side, I enjoy all things regarding 
	the Web. I primarily enjoy building great User Experiences and architecting well-structured, 
	easily maintainable code-bases. My expertise lies in JavaScript and CSS3 as well as UIX 
	development. I was home schooled throughout my middle and high school years, teaching myself 
	everything I know.
