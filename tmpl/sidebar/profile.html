	<h2>Profile</h2>
	<p>
	I'm a 22 year old Web Developer that has been developing web applications since I was 15.
	I'm a technology enthusiast with a love for all things Web. I was home schooled throughout
	my middle and high school years, self-teaching myself everything I know. I am married to
	my beautiful, loving wife, Ashton Templeton, whom without, my life would just be a long
	string of meaningless code.
