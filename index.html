The re-implementation allowed for static typing and type checking at compile time thereby resulting in the Pushup software application to scale appropriately through the use of only necessary syntax.</p></li><li><p>Served as the sole resource in the development of the Pushup Social Windows Phone mobile application using C#.

Software was built using PHP / CakePHP, Apache / Nginx, MySQL, CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, Dojo Toolkit, Ext.js, and running on Ubuntu.</p></li><li><p>Responsible for all client and server side architecture, hardware set ups, the integration of the application into existing internal applications and external sources (API’s) as well as the use of REST based philosophies.</p></li><li><p>Eventually transitioned the software application into a single page instance to allow for better performance and user experience, utilized Dojo and Ext.js to accomplish this endeavor.</p></li><li><p>Developed a static HTML and Bootstrap based website for a cabin rental company, a custom WordPress website for a Personal Life Coach which required the development of custom elements to meet the project stakeholder’s needs, and a JQuery quiz plug-in for a foster care site, <a href="http://www.lovetonurture.com">www.lovetonurture.com</a>.</p></li><li><p>Developed a social platform for a popular trading card game, Redemption Connect (which has since been taken down) which allowed users to search for any card that existed which matched the user’s description of what they were looking and provided a near exact result by using a "fuzzy search algorithm".</p><ul><li><p>Provided supplementary features for the platform, including a "deck export feature" The platform allowed users to export their deck collection to a specific file format which could be read and imported into the table simulator</p></li><li><p>The platform scraped the company's site for tournaments and allowed users to search via locations via the Google Maps API and send a direct RSVP to them.</p></li><li><p>Developed robust card creator that allowed the creation of realistic fan-made cards. Developed game lobby utilizing Node.js and a web-browser to connect old VB6 table simulator across strict NAT protected networks. Also integrated all of this with plug-ins for the simple forums machine forum software</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Took on a project to improve a secured retail shopping e-commerce platform. Worked with JSON, XML, and SOAP web services on the backend, PHP &amp; Guzzle to collect and process analytic &amp; affiliate data for shopping site: <a href="https://cocoonshopping.com/">https://cocoonshopping.com/</a></p></li><li><p>Developed a JQuery quiz plug-in for a foster care site, <a href="http://www.lovetonurture.com">www.lovetonurture.com</a>.</p></li><li><p>Implemented a custom video management tool, silder (<a href="https://gist.github.com/LordZardeck/7205720">https://gist.github.com/LordZardeck/7205720</a>), which allowed videos using the FlexSlider toolkit to stop the slider when playing and continue the slider when done. Built the solution after participating in a Github discussion regarding an issue with said product which resolved the slide change issues that various YouTube users were running into when viewing a video.</p></li><li><p>Developed a JavaScript engine for the Dojo toolkit, DojoCake (<a href="https://github.com/LordZardeck/DojoCake">https://github.com/LordZardeck/DojoCake</a>), which was integrated into the CakePHP framework and allowed JavaScript UI controls to be easily embedded into PHP based applications in a similar fashion to ASP.NET.</p></li><li><p>DojoCake is a library of Helpers and Components for the PHP framework CakePHP. It was originally planned to just be a JavaScript helper to replace the built-in Prototype Framework support. When CakePHP released v1.3.x, they added support for JavaScript Engines. Seeing the potential to be much more than just a JavaScript Engine, DojoCake was changed to a library to support the entire Ajax experience using the Dojo Toolkit and the CakePHP framework. DojoCake now has support for Response Protocols, XHR Requests, Complete Dojo dependency management, and Dojo Widgets.</p></li><li><p>Additionally, wrote and published an article on the use of Dojo Cake which can be found here: <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Languages/Scripting/PHP/A_2156-Dojo-Cake.html">http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Languages/Scripting/PHP/A_2156-Dojo-Cake.html</a></p></li></ul><h3>Framework/Libraries Used</h3><ul class="stats"><li><span>jQuery</span><div class="progress-40"></div></li><li><span>Bootstrap</span><div class="progress-30"></div></li><li><span>Dojo Toolkit</span><div class="progress-70"></div></li><li><span>Ext.js</span><div class="progress-50"></div></li><li><span>CakePHP</span><div class="progress-90"></div></li><li><span>Guzzle</span><div class="progress-10"></div></li></ul></article></section></section></body></html>
